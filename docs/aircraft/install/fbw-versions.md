# Versions and Features

## Version Overview

### Development Edition (recommended)

The Development Edition will have the latest features that will eventually end up in the next Stable release.

In general, this version has the latest fixes and newest features but also a slightly higher risk of containing bugs as 
features had less time to be used and tested by users.

This version updates often, and occasionally several times a day. We recommend updating this version via our installer 
before every start of the simulator.

Every addition to the development version is code-reviewed and tested by several people, our QA Team and also interested 
users. In general, it tends to be very stable and robust.

You can view the latest changes to our aircraft via the commits to the master branch of the project: 
[GitHub Commits to Master](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/commits/master){target=new}.

#### Development Version Changelogs

The latest additions to the project can be seen either in the official

[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/blob/master/.github/CHANGELOG.md){.md-button target=new}

This changelog contains all changes made to the Development Versions of the A32NX and A380X aircraft.

### Stable Edition

Stable is our edition that contains features that have been in the development version for a while and have therefore
been tested by a larger group of users. The Stable edition changes less often than the Development version and is recommended
for users who do not want to update their aircraft as often or require less frequent updates due to compatibility with
3rd party software.

This version will not always be up-to-date, but we work hard at ensuring its compatibility with the current version of 
Microsoft Flight Simulator.
