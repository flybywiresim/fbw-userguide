### Manual Installation

!!! bug "Manual Installation is not recommended"
    We recommend using the FlyByWire Installer for the best download and installation experience. The Installer uses the 
    Cloudflare CDN to ensure fast downloads and also download smaller chunks of the file to ensure more stability during 
    the download process.

    Manual download is done from GitHub, which can be slower and less reliable. 

    Especially during a build and upload of the master branch the manual download can be tricky as files might be 
    missing or being changed during the download process.

    === "Stable Version"

        **Current Stable Version -** <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/flybywiresim/aircraft.svg?color=2F4E5B&style=flat" />

        Stable is our variant that has the least bugs and best performance. This version will not always be up-to-date, 
        but we ensure its compatibility with each major patch from MSFS.

    === "Development Version"

        Development will have the latest features that will end up in the next stable. Bugs are to be expected. 

        It updates whenever something is added to the 'master' branch on GitHub.

    <p style="color:orangered;">**4K vs. 8K Textures:**</p>
    
    We recommend using the **4K texture option** for
     
    - Use frame generation
      - Virtual Reality (VR)
      - DX12 beta
      - or are otherwise limited by your graphics card VRAM amount.
    
    Use the **8K texture option** for the full fidelity experience if your system is powerful enough to support it.
    
    - DX11 recommended
    - HIGH or lower texture resolution setting recommended

![How to find the correct Community folder](../a32nx/assets/find-community-folder.png "How to find the correct Community folder")

To find the Community folder that MSFS is using, please follow these steps:

1. Go to your General Settings in MSFS and activate Developer Mode.
2. Go to the menu and select 'Virtual File System'.
3. Click on 'Packages Folders' and select 'Open Community Folder'.

This opens the Community folder in a Windows Explorer. Please ensure that your add-ons are installed in the folder that is opened.

## Clean Install Steps

### Automatic Clean Install

FBW Installer version 3.0.0 introduced the `Uninstall` feature. To perform an automatic clean install:

- Ensure you have the latest FBW Installer on your machine. 
    - The installer updates itself. If you would like to download our installer again, see the [FlyByWire Installer Section](#flybywire-installer).
- Click on the "Uninstall" button.

!!! tip ""
    This removes the aircraft from your community folder and the extra files in `%appdata` or `%localappdata`.

    Your `Work` folder is retained to save your throttle configuration, FDR files, and any other presets we save. 
    (These are small files and do not need to be deleted to fulfill a "clean install" state.)

### Manual Clean Install

If you would like to manually perform a clean install you first have to delete the 
`flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo` or `flybywire-aircraft-a380-842` folder from your community folder.

We also store additional information related to the aircraft in a separate directory, which is built when you load the 
aircraft in the simulator. You also need to delete the contents of this folder, but not the folder itself. 

These locations are found below:

- [Microsoft Store Version](#microsoft-store-version)
- [Steam Version](#steam-version)

If the above folders are hidden to you, follow the directions on 
[Microsoft's support site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5).

Once in the correct directory, delete all files in the folder but maybe leave the `work` folder:

![img.png](../assets/install/localstate-folder.png)

!!! info "Work Folder"
    The locations below contain a "work" folder. We store important things here that you may not want to delete:

    - Your EFB throttle configuration.
    - Your FDR files (for debugging purposes, which we may ask you to provide).
    - Your lighting presets.
    - Your last fuel tank levels.
    - Your flight model configuration (if you have changed it).

    **It is up to you to keep this folder or not.**

A32NX:<br/>
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\packages\flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo\`
