# INOP System 

## Description
The FlyByWire A380X is an open alpha work in progress. This page describes the systems and features that are currently 
inoperative or not implemented yet.

!!! warning "Work in Progress"
    This page is subject to change pending further development to the aircraft, and thus may be out of date. For the
    most up-to-date list of INOPs and system progress, please see our github page, found

# A380X INOP systems
These systems are currently not operational / these features are missing and shall thus not lead to bug reports.

### ATA 20 Aircraft General / Exterior 3D Model

### ATA 21 Air Con / Pressurization / Ventilation

### ATA 22 Flight Envelope
- PRIM FE part (FMS taking over atm)

### ATA 22 Autoflight / FCU
- AP tuning for A380X
- FLS
- THR NOISE, DCLB

### ATA 22 Flight Management System (FMS)
- Incomplete pages see: fbw-a380x/src/systems/instruments/src/MFD/pages
- Separation into three synchronized FMCs and two FMSs (currently one FMC serving one FMS)
- EO modes / EO SID
- Accurate CI, OPT and REC MAX FL computation
- NADP (see THR NOISE above)
- Fuel planning on FMS/FUEL&LOAD page
- ATC / datalink
- FCU BKUP

### ATA 23 Communication
- RMP: HF, TEL, MENU, SATCOM, DATALINK pages
CIDS: CALLS buttons

### ATA 24 Electrical

### ATA 25 Equipment / Cockpit 3D Model

### ATA 26 Fire and Smoke Protection

### ATA 27 Flight Controls
- Complete SLAT/FLAP CTL implementation (adapted A32NX computers atm)
- Automatic pitch trim setting

### ATA 28 Fuel

- Refuel Driver/Refuel Application placeholder pseudo-FQMS implementation (pre-cursor for realistic FQMS implementation while supporting instant load)
CPIOM etc. not implemented yet.
- Automatic fuel transfer system - Not fully implemented yet i.e. AGT off when 2 engines on
- Manual refueling - Not supported yet
- Integrated Refuel Panel - Simulated in the systems but not modeled in the plane model, or fully connected to ELEC
- MFD entry - Not supported yet (ZFW/ZFWCG entry - Possible via EFB currently for testing)

### ATA 29 Hydraulic System
- No accumulators / LEHGS systems
- Brakes: Only rudimentary + carryover from A32NX
- Gear system: Only rudimentary + carryover from A32NX
- Flap/Slat not implemented (copy from 32NX)
- Hydraulics Cooling

### ATA 30 Ice and Rain Protection

### ATA 31 Indicating / Recording / ECAM / EFIS / Displays
- CDS / displays (automatic) reconfiguration
- PFD backup scales
- Interactive ND
- Vertical Display: Only fixed vertical range (until FL240) w/o FMS trajectory
- Independent QNH
- KCCU soft keyboard
- ECAM: Only basic abnormal sensed procedures, only sensed items are complete
- ECAM abnormal sensed: No navigation up/down, only CLEAR selectable for manual completion
- ECAM: Abnormal non-sensed procedures
- ECAM Deferred procedures
- ECAM ABN secondary failures
- ECAM: Complete STS page implementation
- ECAM: AUTO RCL
- ECAM: Correct behavior of RCL / RCL LAST
- Video: ETACS due to sim limitation
- Latest FMA indications for landing modes (e.g. LAND3 instead of CAT3)
- SD VIDEO page

### ATA 32 Landing Gear / Braking / BTV
- Gear system not implemented (copy from 32NX)
- Wrong door sequence
- Wrong hydraulic behavior
- Brake system not implemented (copy from 32NX)
- Wrong hydraulic behavior
- BTV simplified logic only
- Basic braking distance calculations
- No glide slope adaptation

- MMR implementation including GPIRS position
- GLS

### ATA 34 Surveillance / TCAS / TAWS / WXR / XPDR
- Weather radar / WXR
- TAWS obstacles

### ATA 34 ROW/ROP
