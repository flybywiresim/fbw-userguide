# FlyByWire A32NX Overview

This section of the FlyByWire Documentation is dedicated to the A32NX add-on itself. It covers the software and more 
technical aspects of the FlyByWire add-on.

The A32NX Project is a community-driven open-source project to create a free Airbus A320neo in Microsoft Flight 
Simulator that is as close to reality as possible. It started out as an enhancement project to the default A320neo and 
is now proceeding as an independent add-on project aiming to bring the FlyByWire A32NX up to payware-level systems
depth and functionality, all for free.

## A32NX Quick FAQ

???+ info "Q: I cannot hear the Flaps or PTU in the cockpit anymore?"
    This change was made due to feedback from IRL A320 pilots who identified the sounds could not be heard from the cockpit IRL as they currently are in the simulator.

    The PTU has a toggleable switch on the EFB (flyPad) settings that allows you to hear it in the cockpit when it is running.

??? info "Q: Why is the overall interior lighting different? (Blue light effect on pedestal and displays)"
    Based on IRL A320 pilot feedback, the blue light effect can only be seen from images. Also, the pedestal should be dark at night to improve pilots' vision at night.

??? info "Q: Why does light bleed into the cockpit? Can this be fixed?"
    Unfortunately, no - This is a more profound issue which will require work from the Asobo team.

??? info "Q: The new sounds are different from the default ones, why?"
    The default sounds were shared sounds from other default aircraft. The new sounds are accurate and very well-developed based on the A320 and A320neo pilot feedback.
