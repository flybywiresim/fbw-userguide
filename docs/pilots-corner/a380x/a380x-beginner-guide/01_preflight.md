# Preflight

Before you start your flight in earnest, we have included various features in the A380X that assist in configuring the
aircraft and in-flight support. Some of these features require the aircraft to be powered on. Additionally, these guides
will be linked to the appropriate locations throughout the beginner guide.

## Nav Data

The AIRAC cycle (nav data version) of MSFS's nav data is updated during MSFS's regular sim updates. It's important to
take stock of what AIRAC cycle you are currently using for your flight planning and if it matches the current AIRAC
cycle in MSFS. When using simBrief or other planning tools with older AIRAC cycles, you may
encounter errors during the flight plan import (`NOT IN DATABASE`, `AWY/WPT Mismatch`) OR the 
[flight plan import](#flight-plan-import) may fail due to outdated/incorrect AIRAC cycle.

Owning a Navigraph subscription gives you access to their standalone nav data add-on for MSFS that pairs with their
simBrief flight planning. It will provide you with an up-to-date AIRAC alongside any revisions, and ensure compatibility
when importing from simBrief or planning your flight manually.

## Flight Planning

We highly recommend **not** using the built-in MSFS flight planner (World Map). We recommend
using [SimBrief](https://www.simbrief.com/){target=new} as it is a great resource that provides routing and other
information to successfully plan your flight.

You can choose to use other software/websites to plan your route, but when using simBrief we have a handy import feature
as seen in the next section. Additionally, other tools often don't have the most current nav data AIRAC cycle available.

## Flight Plan Import

If you wish to expedite the process of inputting your flight plan into the FMS, we have incorporated a simBrief import
function for the FMS similar to the real aircraft.

Also, the EFB can import and use your SimBrief flight plan to display the OFP, import fuel and payload data automatically.

### Manual Flight Planning

The [Flight Plan Section](03_preparing-fms.md#flight-plan) in the "Preparing the FMS" guide contains a sample routing to
showcase how to input your waypoints, departure SID, and arrival STAR / procedure.

### Flight Plan Discontinuities

When inputting your flight plan, discontinuities appearing is an intended feature. The page below
describes how to handle these when encountered during your preflight preparations.

## Payload Management

To configure your aircraft, we have provided options onboard the aircraft to load fuel and passengers / baggage. See the
following page and note any advisories.

## EFB Navigraph Charts

To help with navigation during your flight, our flyPad EFB can connect to your Navigraph account to provide access to
all the en route charts for your flight!
