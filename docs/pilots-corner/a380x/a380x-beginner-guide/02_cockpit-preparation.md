# Cockpit Preparation

This guide will help you with preparing and powering up the Airbus A380.  
It includes images to help you understand the locations of all buttons and switches.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    <p style="color:coral;">This is for simulation purposes only.</p>

    The level of detail in this guide is meant to teach an Airbus A380 beginner to start the aircraft correctly.

    A *beginner* is defined as someone familiar with flying a GA aircraft or different types of airliners. Aviation 
    terminology and know-how is a requirement to fly any airliner, even in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

    This guide simplifies the process of starting the aircraft to accomodate beginners and the fact that this is a 
    simulation. More advanced sim pilots can use the [A380X SOP](../a380x-sop.md) directly. 

    When this guide refers to ATC it is referring to any Online ATC network but **NOT** the built-in ATC in the 
    simulator as this is very unrealistic and unreliable.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that your aircraft is in a cold and dark state at a gate.

## Pre-checks

??? tip "What and Why"
    Before starting the aircraft, we need to ensure that all switches are in the correct position.
    This is to prevent any damage to the aircraft systems and to ensure that the aircraft is ready for flight.

    (Of course, this is not an issue in the sim, but in real life it is crucial to check this!)

`ENGINE MASTER SWITCHES (1, 2, 3, 4) .................................. OFF`<br/>
`PARKING BRAKE (OR CHOCKS).............................................. ON`<br/>
`SPEED BRAKE LEVER .............................................. RETRACTED`<br/>
`FLAPS LEVER .................................................... RETRACTED`<br/>
`WEATHER RADAR ........................................................ OFF`<br/>
`ENGINE MODE SELECTOR ................................................ NORM`<br/>

??? tip "How and Where"
    [Flight Deck Overview](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck){ .md-button }

    Use the Flight Deck Overview to locate the items mentioned above. The Flight Deck Overview is a
    clickable cockpit that will show you where each item is located.
    
    * [Engine Master Switches](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/pedestal/engine-master)
    * [Parking Brake](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/pedestal/parking-brake)
    * [Speed Brake Lever](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/pedestal/speed-brake)
    * [Flaps Lever](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/pedestal/flap-lever)
    * [Weather Radar](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/pedestal/surveillance)

    * [Gear Lever](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/main-panel/center-right)
    * [Wipers](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/ovhd/wiper)

After these pre-checks, we can start the aircraft starting with the initial power up.

---

## Initial Power Up

??? tip "What and Why?"
    The initial power up is the first step in starting the aircraft. This is where we turn on the batteries and external
    power to provide power to the aircraft systems.

    The batteries are the first source of power for the aircraft. The external power is used to provide power to the
    aircraft systems when the engines are not running. The aircraft needs at least two external power units to power the 
    whole electrical network.

`ALL BATTERIES (BAT 1, ESS BAT, BAT 2, APU BAT) ........................ ON`<br/>
`EXTERNAL POWER (2, 3, 1, 4) ........................................... ON`<br/>
`COCKPIT LIGHTING ............................................. AS REQUIRED`<br/>

??? tip "How and Where?"
    [Flight Deck Overview](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck){ .md-button }

    Use the Flight Deck Overview to locate the items mentioned above. The Flight Deck Overview is a
    clickable cockpit that will show you where each item is located.

    * [Glareshield Lighting](../../a380x-briefing/flight-deck/glareshield/glare-underside)

## Fire Tests and APU Startup

??? tip "What and Why?"
    The fire tests are done to ensure that the fire detection system is working correctly.

    The APU startup is done to provide power and bleed air to the aircraft systems when the engines are not running.

    Turning on and setting up the radios at this point is also important in case of any emergencies.

`RMP 1 and 2 ........................................................... ON`<br/>
`STANDBY RADIO NAVIGATION ............................................. OFF`<br/>
`COMMUNICATION FREQUENCIES ........................................... TUNE`<br/>
`INTERPHONE RECEPTION ...................................... RELEASE/ADJUST`<br/>

`ENGINE 1/2/3/4 FIRE.................................. CHECK IN and GUARDED`<br/>
`ENGINE 1/2/3/4 AGENT 1 and 2 ......................................... OFF`<br/>
`FIRE TEST .......................................................... PRESS`<br/>
??? note "Fire Test Result"
    Verify that the fire detection systems and extinguishing systems are functional by checking the following items:

    A constant repetitive chime sound, the master warning light flashes on the glareshield, the ECAM displays the engine 
    fire alert messages (ENG 1(2)(3)(4) FIRE, APU FIRE, MLG BAY FIRE), All engine fire pushbutton and the auxiliary power 
    unit fire pushbutton displays in red, the squib light of the engine and apu agent pushbuttons are illuminated, the disch 
    light of the engine and auxiliary power unit agent pushbuttom illuminates and all fire lights on the engine master panel 
    illuminates.

`APU MASTER SWITCH ..................................................... ON`<br/>
`APU START ............................................................. ON`<br/>
??? note "APU Start"
    You can monitor the APU start on the SD APU page which comes up automatically when the APU is started. Once the APU 
    is running, the APU page will show switch back to the previous page. 

    The APU page should look similar to this now:

    ![APU Page](../assets/beginner-guide/02_cockpit-preparation/sd-apu-page.png){loading=lazy}

`EXTERNAL POWER .................................................... AS REQ`<br/>
??? note "External Power"
    It is recommended to keep the external power units to ON to reduce the APU load in hot weather conditions.

## Cockpit Preparation Flow

The cockpit preparation flow is an easy way to remember the steps to startup and setup the aircraft correctly.
It follows a flow starting on the overhead panel on the left buttom moving up and then to the right.
Then it continues the flow on the main panel starting and moving to the pedestal, setting up the FMS to then continue
to the glareshield. At last the lateral consoles are checked and set up.

Normally, the flow is done by the two pilots in the cockpit. The First Officer (FO) does the overhead panel, main panel, 
pedestal, and his side of the cockpit for the glareshield, lateral consoles and his MFD. 

The Captain does his side of the cockpit for the glareshield and lateral consoles and his MFD.

In the simulator, we are usually alone, so we will do the flow on our own.

??? note "Requesting ATC IFR Clearance"
    Before departing for the flight, we must obtain an IFR clearance from ATC. The clearance may be obtained from
    clearance delivery or another specific frequency, depending on the airport and available services.

    If you are not flying on a network and are using the built-in ATC menu, simply find the appropriate selection in the
    menu and request for IFR clearance.

    Clearances will usually provide the following information below. As a pilot, you would need to read back the 
    clearance correctly or acknowledge it if using the built-in ATC menu.

    * Cleared to the destination via specified route in the filed flight plan.
    * Initial cleared altitude after departure.
    * Assigned SID for departure OR radar vectors
    * Assigned departing runway.
    * Transponder/squawk code.
    * Departure frequency.
