## Description

There are two Multi Function Displays (MFDs). There is one for the Captain and one for the First Officer.

The MFD displays:

- The surveillance pages (SURV)
- The FCU backup (FCU BKUP)

The MFD is interactive: The flight crew can navigate through the pages, and can consult, enter or modify the data via 
the KCCU.
