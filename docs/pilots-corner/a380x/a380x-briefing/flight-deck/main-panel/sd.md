## Description

The SD screen has three horizontal sections:

- The top section provides the system display page, the STATUS page, or the STATUS MORE page. In normal operation, the 
  SD provides system display pages. The system display pages appear:
    - Automatically, depending on the flight phase. For more details Refer to Normal Operation, or
    - When manually-selected by the flight crew. For more details refer to [ECP](../pedestal/ecam-cp.md).
- The middle section displays permanently-displayed data such as: External temperature, time,
  aircraft weight, CG, and Fuel On Board (FOB).

In addition, after an alert due to a system failure, the SD displays:

- The applicable system display page, if any.
