# Description

!!! warning "Reset Panels"
    The Reset Panels are currently not functional in the A380X.

Some systems that operate abnormally, or that are detected failed by the ECAM, can be recovered by
a computer reset.
The flight crew can perform a computer reset by using the cockpit controls (e.g. pushbuttons), or the
reset buttons.

!!! warning ""
    The flight crew can attempt a computer reset only when:

    - An ECAM/OEB/TDU procedure requests to reset the system, or
    - The List of Computer Reset Procedures permits to reset the system (Refer to List of
            Computer Reset Procedures), or
    - When approved by MCC in the case of specific TR failures in flight, which are
            confirmed by the Airbus Real Time Health Monitoring system.

The reset procedures give the conditions to perform a reset and also describes the precautions to take and the effects 
of the reset.

Unless indicated differently in the reset procedure, to perform a system reset:

- Set the normal control to OFF, or pull the reset button
- Wait three seconds if a normal cockpit control is used, or one second if a reset button was pulled
- Set the normal control to ON, or push the reset button.
 
!!! warning ""
    Several resets must not be performed at the same time, unless indicated in the applicable reset procedure.

Note: 

1. In flight, before taking any action on the reset buttons, the PF and PM must crosscheck and verify that the 
reset button corresponds to the affected system
2. The flight crew should report any in-flight reset to the maintenance.
