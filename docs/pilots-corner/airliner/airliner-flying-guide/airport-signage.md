# Airport Signage and Markings

!!! info "Scenery / Accuracy Issues"
Please be aware that the default scenery or 3rd party sceneries may not be entirely accurate with the posted signage
on the ground. However, this guide will explain how to read and understand them.

## FAA Quick Reference Guide

The FAA has a handy guide available for download that contains images of all the pertinent signs you may encounter,
their purpose, and location at the airport.

There are two types of signage at airports - operational guidance signs and mandatory instruction signs.

## Operational Guidance Signs

^^Location Signs^^

- These signs are yellow text on a black background. Typically, indicates a specific taxiway or runway your aircraft is
  on or entering.

^^Direction/Runway Exit Signs^^

- Black text on a yellow background. These will have an arrow indicating the direction to turn, which helps pilots
  identify what taxiways they are approaching or runway exits towards a specified runway.

^^Stop Bar Signs^^

- White text on a blue background. These are non-standard signs that may appear at some airports, usually indicating
  which taxiway a stop bar is positioned. Airports usually use more conventional traffic signs you may see on the road,  
  such a regular stop sign. See the [FAA Guide](#faa-quick-reference-guide) for samples.

## Mandatory Instruction Signs

^^Runway Signs^^

- White text on a red background. These signs inform pilots that a runway intersection is ahead.

^^Holding Position Signs / Markings^^

There are typically three very important holding position signs / markings that appear on the ground at airports. At
various airports that operate with low visibility, these positions are also paired with a line of red lights across a
taxiway to help visually indicate the holding positions.

1. Runway Holding Position
    - Two sets of solid yellow lines and two sets of dashed yellow lines indicate a holding position for a runway ahead.
      These **must never be crossed** without express permission from ATC.

2. Taxiway Holding Position
    - Single dashed yellow line. If this is present along your taxi route, it will indicate a position that ground
      control may request you stop and hold short before another taxiway.

3. ILS Critical Area
    - Solid yellow lines that look like a railroad or ladder. These are another form of hold short point but indicate a
      critical area Where your aircraft would violate the ILS approach airspace while on the ground.

## Taxiway Lighting

Taxiway lighting helps the flight crew and ground crew navigate the airport at night or in low visibility and stop at
the appropriate locations as given by ATC.

There are usually two types of lighting on taxiways - centerline and edge. Depending on the airport operator, the lightning
may differ if the airport operates in low visibility conditions.

- Centerline lighting is green on the principal taxiways located along the taxiway centerline. These lights can
  alternate between green and yellow when a taxiway crosses a runway, or highlight a "lead-off" taxiway from a runway to
  join a taxiway.
- Edge lighting is typically blue and characteristically appears at the edges of a taxiway. Spacing can range from
  50-200ft apart, usually condensing in distance when approaching an intersection.
