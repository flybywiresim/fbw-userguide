We are very excited to finally provided our users with our open alpha stage developer preview of the A380X. We have taken steps to ensure at minimum that the aircraft is
capable of an A to B flight on VATSIM.

These release notes are meant to provide an initial outlook into the features available for our very first release of this aircraft. 

We have two options for you to choose in our installer.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- 4K Texture Option

    ---

    [System Requirements](../../aircraft/install/installation.md#estimated-system-requirements-for-a380x){.md-button}

    Includes our 4K downscaled cabin, cockpit and exterior textures. Choose this option for reduced stutters, better performance, with HIGH or lower texture resolution setting. 

    Additionally, if you intend to use the following:
  
    - Use frame generation
    - Virtual Reality (VR)
    - DX12 beta
    - or are otherwise limited by your graphics card VRAM amount.

- 8K Textures Option

    ---

    [System Requirements](../../aircraft/install/installation.md#estimated-system-requirements-for-a380x){.md-button}

    Includes our 8K full resolution cabin, cockpit and exterior textures. This is the full fidelity experience and our recommendation if your system is powerful enough to support it. Realistic and in high detail.

    - DX11 recommended
    - HIGH or lower texture resolution setting recommended
