- [x] Introduction of an air starter unit for enhanced ground operations.
- [x] New flight planning system with support for missed approaches, NAV in go-arounds, and alternate route planning.
- [x] Takeoff performance calculator integrated into the EFB for precise pre-flight calculations.
- [x] Autopilot and control law improvements for better flight handling.
- [x] Support for higher sim rates and a new controller in the flyPad.
- [x] A number of new ECAM warnings and countless accuracy fixes throughout the aircraft systems.

For a full release changelog - [see here](#changelog)

!!! tip "Recommended Settings"
    Before your first flight, please make sure to read our [Recommended Settings](../../aircraft/install/settings.md) guide.

    !!! warning "**Navigraph + SimBrief Integration**"
        The authentication process for Navigraph services (SimBrief included) has changed. Please see the following page for more information:

        [SimBrief Integration](../../aircraft/a32nx/feature-guides/simbrief.md){.md-button}

    **Navigraph Airframe**

    The team at Navigraph have been kind enough to include our airframe as a selectable option on SimBrief. You no longer have to save our custom airframe to your account to 
    use it. If we decide to make any changes, it will be automatically updated in their system.

!!! warning "Important User Experience Changes"

    Please note the following changes.

    SimBridge is now required to use the following features:

    - Terrain on ND 
    - MCDU Remote Display
    - External Printer
    - Local Files feature
    - Company Routes

    [SimBridge Guides Here](../../tools/simbridge/index.md){.md-button}

    - Custom Flight Management System.
        - See the [Special Notes Section](../../aircraft/a32nx/feature-guides/cFMS.md#special-notes) on our custom FMS page for more details.
    - Weather radar is inoperable as we wait for Asobo implementations.
    - MSFS Built-in ATC and VFR maps are partially supported. [Guides Here](../../aircraft/a32nx/feature-guides/flight-planning.md)
    - [Discontinuities](../../pilots-corner/a32nx/a32nx-advanced-guides/flight-planning/disco.md) may now appear in your flight plan â€” they are a feature and not a bug.
    - [Throttle calibration](../../aircraft/common/flypados3/throttle-calibration.md) is **mandatory**.
